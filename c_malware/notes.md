# TCP Backdoor malware

- We want to connect to the server that we are going to open from our shell.
- A function that will wait for the incoming commands and will execute it on the shell.
- Automtically start the malware when the machine is rebooted
- It should be able to start any exe or other programs on its own by navigating through different paths 
- Implementing a keylogger

- For persistence of the malware we will use the registry keys stored in the victims system windows to make it run the malware every time he turns on the system.
