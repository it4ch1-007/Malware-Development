# Data Streams

- Get your commands inside a legit looking file for example "payload.txt"
- now:
```
type payload.txt > ads.png:payload
```
- Here we load the type of the file named 'payload.txt' inside the ads.png using the data stream (payload)./
- Data stream is not written inside the file and thus the file size will remain the same but only the data will be attached to the file as a stream.
```
see it using (dir /r) command.
```
- This is just to hide the files and execute them with  special commands that can be executed using malwares.
