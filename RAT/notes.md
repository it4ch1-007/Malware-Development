- Our working environment will be the temp folder while the Startup directory will be used to initialise the malware for its activities.

- We will use a .cmd file for this. These type of files are loaded into the memory before even being executed.

- .bak files are backup files created for backup of other files or databases.

- We need administrative permissions for creating a directory inside the system by scripting thus we are going to elevate the stage2.cmd command script such that it opens the stage3.ps1 in administrative privileges.

## Self development
#### Persistence
    - We have a command prompt file that will be hidden inside an image and as soon as the image is opened the command line is executed.

    - This command line will then save a file named starter.ps1 inside the startup directory that will start the RAT everytime we turn on the computer.

    - Now we have to disable the windows defender using the starter.ps1 script.
